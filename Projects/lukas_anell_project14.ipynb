    "In The Data Mine, I found that I enjoy learning R a lot. Being able to quickly see results and visualizing the data I work with is nice, and I like how simple it can be sometimes. Even when I don't know something, R documentation is always super helpful and I've learned so much just from using Google and finding documentation for a certain function. I feel like this class has been huge in helping me be more prepared for my future when I'll probably be using R a lot as a Data Science major. I wish there were more opportunities to work with others in this class, outside of just office hours with the TAs and my roommate, but I know future classes have that so I'm looking forward to taking more advanced Data Mine classes."
